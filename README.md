# The problem:
Although the usage of smart phones has grown increasingly over the past years, many people tend to type slowly and/or incorrectly.
Our application will put an emphasis on the ability to type quickly without mistakes by practicing typing texts in single/multi player games and showing statistical results on the performance.

# Core Feature:
single/multi-player typing game on different texts: the player will be shown a certain text and has to type it as quick and as correct as possible.

# Complementary Features:
- Selecting a theme for the texts in the games from a wide range of topics.
- Ability to invite friends to the game and compete against them or play against random player.
- Adding texts of your own and sharing them publicly or with friends (if you want to) and getting score for that.
- Players can rank the texts they type.
- Showing basic statistics depending on typing performance.
